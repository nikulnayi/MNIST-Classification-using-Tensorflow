Description:
This repository contains code for training and evaluating a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The code demonstrates three different approaches to building the model: sequential, functional, and custom model classes.

The repository includes the following files:

main.py: The main script that loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses the data, defines the model architecture, trains the model, and evaluates its performance on the test set.
deeplearningModels.py: A module containing the functional_model and MyCustomeModel classes that define the model architectures using the functional and custom approaches, respectively.
utils.py: A module containing utility functions, including display_some_example for visualizing random examples from the dataset.
README.md: A readme file with instructions on how to use the code and additional information about the repository.
The repository provides an easy-to-understand implementation of the MNIST classification task using TensorFlow and Keras. It serves as a starting point for experimenting with different model architectures and training techniques for image classification tasks.
